I used "The lightmapper" extension to create the various UV maps for HUBS

Everything is basically ready to export, so you can change things and re-export and all will be OK
Except if you change something that needs re-baking

Then you basically have to go through each material, and re-wire it to use the normal shader, and then run the lightmapper thing - then switch the materials back to be correct for hubs export - taking care to setup the lightmapper not to apply the materials.
